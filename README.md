# React Currency Converter ðŸ¤‘ ðŸ’¶

Quick and easy to use currency converter app. One of my first challenges in React that helped me understand the basic hooks. I used a JSON file to get the currency rates but I also practiced by using a currency exchange rate API.

This project allowed me to introduce TypeScript notions, my objectif is to learn more about it and use it in my next projects.

4. You can hide the list of currencies to have a better view of the app
5. The calculator will show you the amount in the currency you chose
